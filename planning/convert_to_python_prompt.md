# R to Python Conversion Plan: Hierarchical Compartmental Reserving Model

## Prompt
```
Ultrathink about how to convert the R Jupyter Notebook in `src/reserving.ipynb` into a Python Jupyter Notebook that leverages the Stan language for Python. The output charts should be as close to the original R implementation as possible. Make a clear multi-step plan for this task in `planning/convert_to_python.md` then review the plan and sketch the implementation subtasks required, desribing any pros/cons where divergent approaches are practical.
